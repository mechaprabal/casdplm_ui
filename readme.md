# Carbon Accounting System

## Summary

This repository hosts a comprehensive web application designed for Carbon
Accounting, enabling users to analyze and track carbon emissions data. The
system integrates historical data from 194 countries, spanning the years 1990
to 2021, providing a robust framework for understanding global carbon trends.

This application was showcased as part of the SWAYAM NPTEL online course,
[Carbon Accounting & Sustainable Designs in Product Lifecycle
Management](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc24_ge49/preview), where it
served as a practical demonstration of key concepts in carbon management and
sustainable design.
